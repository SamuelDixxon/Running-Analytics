# Running Analytics

Running Analytics is a small project to generate some analysis through graphical plotting packages in python of activities recorded for users in the strava fitness tracking app. Some potential use cases for these scripts and plots could be for improved training, informed reflection of progress acquired in historical data, and generating cool art.


## Purpose

Exercise is a great way to relieve stress and become closer to our natural beings. Its also a great way to get out doors and experience the physical world and our beautiful planet! The beauty of exercise today is that there is no barrier based on shape, size, gender, or sex! This repository intends to support those who are interested in utilizing the strava application ( a common, popular fitness tracker ) to document their journies and investigate to the quantitative side of the activity.

"It's not the Destination, It's the journey." - Ralph Waldo Emerson

## Getting Started

All of these scripts will utilize the Anaconda software suite, particularly Jupyter Notebooks, to run python for analysis.
Additionally the setup will require interacting with the Strava API. This will require generating an API key and some setup, however is fairly straightforward and described in the steps below.

### Prerequisites

Requirements for the software and other tools to build, test and push 
- [Anaconda Software Suite (Python)](https://www.anaconda.com/)
- [Strava API](https://developers.strava.com/)

### Installing

- Clone this repository 
    - If you need help cloning, check out Github's documentation here: [Cloning a Repository](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/creating-and-managing-repositories/cloning-a-repository)
- Visit the link above and download anaconda software suite for your machine
- Once installed, open the jupyter package by searching for Jupyter in the installed directory
- Confirm you can run python code through a simple hello world print statemnent. Cells can be run in a modular sense with the play button at the top or by the keyboard shortcut (cntrl-entr)
- Generate the API key for your account throught the website linked above and the following steps:

<!-- ## Running the tests

Explain how to run the automated tests for this system

### Sample Tests

Explain what these tests test and why -->

    Give an example

<!-- ### Style test

Checks if the best practices and the right coding style has been used.

    Give an example
